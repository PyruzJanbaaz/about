# about
Hi there! I'm Pyruz, a software developer with over 15 years of experience in building web applications. I specialize in JavaScript, React, and Node.js and have worked on projects ranging from small websites to large-scale enterprise applications. When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, playing guitar, or trying out new coffee shops. Currently, I'm working on a personal project to build a mobile app that helps people find local hiking trails. I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn, so feel free to reach out!
